# sonarQube-Jenkins

To execute SonarQube in Jenkins, you can use a pipeline that includes the following steps:

1.-Configure the SonarQube server in Jenkins: Before starting, you need to make sure that the SonarQube server is configured in Jenkins. You can do this by going to "Dashboard > Manage Jenkins > Configure System" and adding the required details.

2.- Configure the SonarQube scanner: you need to make sure that the SonarQube scanner is installed and configured in Jenkins. you can do this using the following code in our pipeline:

tools {
    // Install the SonarQube Scanner tool
    sonarqubeScanner 'SonarQubeScanner'
}

3.- Run the SonarQube analysis: You can run the SonarQube analysis using the following code in our pipeline:

stage('SonarQube analysis') {
    steps {
        // Run the SonarQube analysis
        script {
            def scannerHome = tool 'SonarQubeScanner'
            withSonarQubeEnv('SonarQube') {
                sh "${scannerHome}/bin/sonar-scanner"
            }
        }
    }
}

4.- Wait for the analysis result: You can wait for the analysis result using the following code in our pipeline:

stage('Quality Gate') {
    steps {
        // Wait for the SonarQube analysis to complete and check the quality gate status
        waitForQualityGate abortPipeline: true
    }
}
